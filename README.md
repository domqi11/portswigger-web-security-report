## 📋 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on exploration of critical web application vulnerabilities using the PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs. Each vulnerability is thoroughly analyzed, exploited, and documented following professional security reporting standards. This portfolio demonstrates my practical cybersecurity skills, methodical approach to vulnerability assessment, and ability to provide actionable remediation recommendations.

## 🎯 Vulnerabilities Covered

This portfolio focuses on the most critical and industry-relevant web application security vulnerabilities:

| # | Vulnerability Type | Severity | Exploitability | Prevalence |
|---|-------------------|----------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | SQL Injection | Critical | Medium | High |
| 2 | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | High | Easy | Very High |
| 3 | Authentication Vulnerabilities | Critical | Medium | High |
| 4 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| 5 | OS Command Injection | Critical | Hard | Medium |
| 6 | Access Control Vulnerabilities | High | Medium | High |
| 7 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | High | Hard | Medium |
| 8 | DOM-based Vulnerabilities | Medium | Medium | High |

## 🧪 Methodology

Each vulnerability assessment follows a comprehensive methodology:

1. **Discovery** - Initial vulnerability identification process
2. **Analysis** - Technical deep-dive into the vulnerability mechanics
3. **Exploitation** - Step-by-step proof-of-concept with Burp Suite
4. **Impact Assessment** - Evaluation of potential business consequences
5. **Remediation** - Actionable recommendations with code examples
